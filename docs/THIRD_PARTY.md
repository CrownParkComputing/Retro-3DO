## MAME — BSD-3-Clause

Parts of the CLIO expansion-bus implementation in `core/core/clio.cpp` are
derived from MAME's 3DO devices (`src/mame/misc/3do_clio.cpp`), specifically
the poll-register bit layout and the fact that SELECTION names a device by the
value written rather than by the address written to.

## MAME's CR-560B device — BSD-3-Clause

The CD-ROM drive model in `core/core/xbus.cpp` follows MAME's `cr560b` device
(`src/devices/machine/cr560b.cpp`), copyright Angelo Salese, BSD-3-Clause. The
drive is a Panasonic CR-560B on a pre-IDE MKE interface - the drive the FZ-1 and
FZ-10 actually contain - and that device is where its command set is written
down. Nothing else consulted here documents it: not the patents, not The 3DO
Company's SDK, not the community register map.

Taken from it: the command opcodes, that every command echoes its opcode in the
first reply byte, the shape of the version and data-path-check replies, and the
drive status bits.

Worth recording that two of those were established here independently first, by
sweeping the reply against the real boot ROM, and MAME then confirmed them: the
opcode echo, and the twelve-byte length of the version reply. The same notice as
above applies - see the MAME entry.

## libchdr — BSD-3-Clause

`core/third_party/libchdr`, vendored whole in the core repository, is used to
read CHD images. CHD is how
nearly every 3DO dump in the wild is stored, so this is the ordinary path into
the emulator rather than an optional extra. It is self-contained: it brings its
own LZMA, miniz and zstd, so there is nothing to find on the host and nothing
extra to cross compile for Android or iOS.

Its bundled dependencies carry their own permissive terms: the LZMA SDK is
public domain, miniz is MIT, and zstd is BSD/GPLv2 dual licensed (BSD taken).

## Reference-source history

No FreeDO, 4DO, Opera or `opera-libretro` source file is compiled or vendored
into this project. Their code was nevertheless studied during development, and
some earlier Retro-3DO routines were ports before the September 2026
reimplementation pass. That historical exposure and the relevant FreeDO notice
are disclosed in [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md); it must not be described as
clean-room merely because the current routines were later replaced.
