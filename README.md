# Retro-3DO

A new 3DO Interactive Multiplayer emulator codebase for phones, tablets and
desktops. Its historical reference exposure is disclosed in
[docs/PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md).

One C++ codebase builds for Android, iOS, macOS, Linux and Windows. There is no
per-platform front end: SDL provides the window, input, audio and GPU on every
target, and Dear ImGui draws the launcher and the in-game overlay.

> **Status: games run.** A real 3DO BIOS passes its power-on self test, CD media
> is mounted through XBUS/MADAM DMA, and the ARM, CEL, matrix and DSP paths run
> commercial titles. Compatibility is still in progress, but Road Rash and The
> Need for Speed both boot into correctly rendered gameplay. See
> [Roadmap](#roadmap) and the [Opera parity audit](docs/OPERA_AUDIT.md).

## Why this exists as a separate core

Two reasons, and the second is the one with a deadline attached.

**It is written to be fast on a phone.** The widely-used 3DO cores descend from
a 1990s desktop emulator. Their CPU is a plain interpreter that re-decodes every
instruction on every execution, their graphics chip is scalar C, and they
present frames from inside the emulation thread — so a slow present stalls
emulation, and the machine appears to run slow when it is really being
throttled. This core decodes each instruction once and caches it, and never
presents from the emulation path at all.

**Its current architecture is project-owned and auditable.** The former
direct-port routines have been replaced with implementations structured around
public ARM/3DO documentation, patents and focused tests. The project is still
historically reference-exposed; replacing code does not make its development
history clean-room. [docs/PROVENANCE.md](docs/PROVENANCE.md) records both facts.

## Building

### Linux and Windows

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DRETRO3DO_USE_SYSTEM_SDL=ON
cmake --build build -j
./build/retro3do
```

Choose **Demo** in the launcher, or run `./build/retro3do --demo`, to boot the
included original hardware demonstration without a commercial BIOS or game.
The 1.7 KB bare-metal ARM ROM drives MADAM/VDLP video, DSPP audio and PBUS input
through the emulator's normal hardware paths. Its complete source and
reproducible build are in [`demo/`](demo/).

Drop `-DRETRO3DO_USE_SYSTEM_SDL=ON` to build the vendored SDL from source
instead, which is what the mobile targets do.

### Tests

```sh
./build/retro3do_tests
```

They run on the host, with no window and no device. A bug found on hardware gets
reproduced here before it gets fixed.

### Android

```sh
cd android
./gradlew :app:bundleDebug -PBUILD_WITH_CMAKE=1
```

Gradle drives the same root `CMakeLists.txt` the desktop build uses; there is no
separate Android copy of the emulator.

On Android the app requests the fastest full-resolution panel mode up to
120 Hz and keeps SDL presentation vsynced to it. The 3DO itself remains at its
hardware-correct 50/60 Hz field rate; presentation refresh never changes game
or audio speed. A 60 Hz-only panel therefore remains at 60 Hz.

The Settings panel and in-game overlay offer optional 125% and 150% ARM boosts.
Only the emulated ARM instruction budget changes: video fields remain at 50/60
Hz, DSP output remains 44.1 kHz, and CD timing remains native. This can reduce
CPU-bound slowdown without fast-forwarding sound or FMV; it cannot raise a
frame rate deliberately capped by the game.

The Android Settings page can sign in to a registered RetroMedia account and
download one selected artwork piece per matched 3DO title (2D cover,
screenshot, thumbnail or title screen). Sessions are encrypted with the
Android Keystore; passwords are never written to the emulator settings. Media
is resized and cached in private app storage, then shown directly on library
cards. Downloads happen only when the user presses **Download Missing
Artwork**, and use that account's normal daily allowance/credit balance.

### iOS and macOS

```sh
ios/build-ios-macos.sh        # iPhone and iPad
macos/build-macos.sh          # universal Retro-3DO.app
```

Both are macOS-only, and deliberately so — a Linux cross-build can make
something that sideloads but never something submittable, and `actool` (the app
icon) and `codesign` exist nowhere else.

Neither has been run: everything else in this repository is built and tested
from Linux. [docs/APPLE_BUILD.md](docs/APPLE_BUILD.md) is the handover — what is
set up, what to expect on the first real Xcode run, and how to sign, notarise
and submit.

## Layout

```
core/           submodule: the 3DO itself, and libchdr. No platform headers, ever.
src/platform/   SDL: window, events, pacing, presentation
src/ui/         Dear ImGui: launcher and overlay
tests/          host-side tests
android/        Gradle shell around the shared CMake tree
macos/          the same, for the desktop bundle: plist, entitlements, script
assets/apple/   asset catalogue, compiled into the icon by actool
```

`core/` is [retro3do-core](https://github.com/CrownParkComputing/retro3do-core),
which used to be `src/core/` here. It moved out because a second application --
the iOS one -- needs the same emulator, and a core that only builds inside one
app gets copied into the other and then the two drift apart.

The rule that keeps this working: if something in `core/` ever needs a platform
header, it belongs in `src/platform/` instead.

## Roadmap

- [x] ARM60 CPU with a decoded-instruction cache
- [x] Memory map and big-endian bus
- [x] SDL application shell, ImGui launcher
- [x] Android and iOS build paths off one CMake tree
- [x] macOS bundle target, icons and signing set up (unrun: see docs/APPLE_BUILD.md)
- [x] CLIO — interrupts, timers, video counters
- [x] VDLP — display list to framebuffer
- [x] MADAM — the CEL engine: affine mapping, indexed and direct cels
- [x] DSP — instruction engine, DMA inputs and DAC output
- [x] Disc images: ISO, BIN, CUE, with sector layout detected not assumed
- [x] SPORT — page copy and fill; the ROM does not pass its self test without it
- [x] XBUS + MADAM DMA: animated startup and disc loading
- [x] Emulation on its own thread, with one pacing policy and a triple-buffered frame mailbox
- [x] Audio output path: lock-free ring, SDL sink
- [x] Controller: keyboard and gamepad through SDL
- [x] File browser, so the app is usable without a keyboard
- [x] Android scoped storage (SAF): the user grants folders, the app requests no storage permission
- [x] On-screen controls, movable, saved per device
- [x] Settings that survive a restart
- [x] Original built-in no-BIOS hardware demonstration ROM
- [x] RetroMedia account artwork downloads and illustrated library cards (Android)
- [x] Scanline-timed VDLP updates
- [ ] Full MADAM CEL pause/status timing
- [ ] Remaining CD queries, CD audio and additional PBUS peripherals
- [ ] Save states
